# Genome-Assembly
When the genome of a species is to be sequenced, the chromosomes 
from many cells are broken at random positions into small fragments, 
which are sequenced, and reassembled into long sequences (contigs). 
Contigs may be assembled into longer sequences. The resulting 
collection of sequences after assembly is called a genome assembly.
De Bruijn graph-based assembly approach was originally proposed to 
handle the assembly of repetitive regions better.

In this task we should assemble two types of reads using the De 
Bruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the 
original sequence from that representation.
